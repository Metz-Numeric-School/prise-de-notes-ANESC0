#### 5.5.1.1 Chapter 5: Network Concepts

**Introduction**: In this chapter, you learned about the various components, devices, services, and protocols that form a network. These elements are organized into different network topologies such as PANs, LANs, VLANs, WLANs, and VPNs. You also discovered the different methods for connecting computers and networks to the Internet, including both wired connections (DSL, cable, fiber optics) and wireless connections (satellite, cellular services). Additionally, tethering allows network devices to connect to the Internet through a cell phone.

**TCP/IP Model**:
- **Network Access Layer**: Handles the physical connection to the network.
- **Internet Layer**: Manages addressing and routing of data.
- **Transport Layer**: Ensures reliable data transmission.
- **Application Layer**: Provides network services to applications.

**Wireless Technologies and Standards**:
- **WLAN Protocols and IEEE 802.11 Standards**: Use two radio frequency bands, 5 GHz (802.11a, 802.11ac) and 2.4GHz (802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n).
- **Close Proximity Connectivity Protocols**: Includes Bluetooth and NFC.
- **Smart Home Protocols**: Zigbee (open standard based on IEEE 802.15.4) and Z-Wave (proprietary standard).
- **Cellular Generations**: Evolution from 1G (analog voice) to 5G (supports AR and VR).

**Network Hardware Devices**:
- **NICs (Network Interface Cards)**: Provide physical connectivity for end devices, available in wired or wireless versions, and can be installed inside a computer or connected via USB.
- **Repeaters and Hubs**: Operate at Layer 1, repeat network signals.
- **Switches**: Operate at Layer 2, forward frames based on MAC addresses.
- **Routers**: Operate at Layer 3, forward packets based on IP addresses.

**Network Security Devices**:
- **Firewalls**: Protect data and equipment from unauthorized access.
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems)**: Passively monitor network traffic.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems)**: Actively monitor traffic and respond immediately to prevent malicious traffic.
- **UTM (Unified Threat Management) Systems**: All-in-one security appliances that combine IDS/IPS functionality with stateful firewall services.

**Network Cables and Connectors**:
- **Cable Types**: Different sizes and costs, varying in maximum bandwidth and distances. Coax and twisted pair cables carry data electrically, while fiber optic cables use light.
- **Twisted Pair Cables**: Use T568A and T568B wiring schemes to define the order of wire connections at the cable's end.
- **Cable Construction**: Built and tested a straight-through UTP Ethernet network cable using either the T568A or T568B standards.
